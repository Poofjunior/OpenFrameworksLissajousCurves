Welcome to a test application created with Open Frameworks!

To run this application, you first need OpenFrameworks installed on your
machine.  Then, in the directory where you cloned this repository, type 
     make 
at the command line.  After the compilation, you can open the bin directory and 
run the created file from there.  

Note: I have successfully tested this application on the Raspberry Pi.  To 
compile it, I downloaded Open Frameworks for the Rasperry Pi here at:

https://github.com/openFrameworks-RaspberryPi/openFrameworks/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Getting-Started

Note that I used the Raspbian distribution.

Note to self: Don't forget to "make clean" before commits.
